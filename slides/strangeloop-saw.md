# What is SAW?

* A tool to construct \alert{models} of program behavior

    * Works with C (LLVM), Java (JVM), and others in progress

    * Also supports specifications written in Cryptol

* Models can then be \alert{proved} to have certain properties

    * Equivalence with specifications

    * Guarantees to return certain values

* Proofs generally done using \alert{automated} reasoning tools

    * So similar level of effort to testing

    * Uses a technique called symbolic execution, plus SAT/SMT

# Property Based Testing

* Rather than testing individual cases, state general properties

* Then can test those properties on specific values

    * Manually selected

    * Randomly generated

* For example, this function should always return a non-zero value:

~~~~ .c
int add_commutes(uint32_t x, uint32_t y) {
    return x + y == y + x;
}
~~~~

* The QuickCheck approach is a common implementation of this paradigm

# XOR Swap Example

* Say we're using the XOR-based trick for swapping values:

~~~~ .c
void swap_xor(uint32_t *x, uint32_t *y) {
  *x = *x ^ *y;
  *y = *x ^ *y;
  *x = *x ^ *y;
}
~~~~

* Focus on values, since that's where the tricky parts are
    * Pointers used just so it can be a separate function

# A Specification for Swapping

~~~~ .c
void swap_direct(uint32_t *x, uint32_t *y) {
  uint32_t tmp;
  tmp = *y;
  *y = *x;
  *x = tmp;
}
~~~~

~~~~ .c
int swap_correct(uint32_t x, uint32_t y) {
  uint32_t x1 = x, x2 = x, y1 = y, y2 = y;
  swap_xor(&x1, &y1);
  swap_direct(&x2, &y2);
  return (x1 == x2 && y1 == y2);
}
~~~~

# Manual Swap Testing

~~~~ .c
int main() {
  assert(swap_correct(0, 0));
  assert(swap_correct(0, 1));
  assert(swap_correct(1, 0));
  assert(swap_correct(32, 76));
  assert(swap_correct(0, 0xFFFFFFFF));
  assert(swap_correct(0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF));
  return 0;
}
~~~~

* Advantages

    * Ensures that you will always test important values

    * Carefully chosen tests can cover many important cases quickly

* Disadvantages

    * May miss classes of inputs that you didn't think of

    * Non-deterministics: different runs may have different results

# Random Swap Testing

~~~~ .c
int main() {
  for(int idx = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    uint32_t x = rand();
    uint32_t y = rand();
    assert(swap_correct(x, y));
  }
  return 0;
}
~~~~

* Advantages

    * Better theoretical coverage of input space

    * Number of tests limited only by available processing power

* Disadvantages

    * May miss important classes of inputs that are easy to identify by hand

# Translating Programs to Pure Functions

* $\lambda x.~x + 1$ is a function

    * takes an argument $x$, and returns $x + 1$

* `swap_direct`: $\lambda (x, y).~(y, x)$

* `swap_xor`: $\lambda (x, y).~(x \oplus y \oplus x \oplus y \oplus y, x
  \oplus y \oplus y)$

    * but $x \oplus x \equiv 0$ and $x \oplus 0 \equiv x$

* Translation achieved in SAW using a technique called *symbolic
  execution*

    * Think: an interpreter with expressions in place of values

    * Every variable's value at the end is an expression representing
      *all possible values* it might take

# SAT and SMT Solvers

* Automated provers for mathematical theorems

    * Such as: $\forall x, y.~(x \oplus y \oplus x \oplus y \oplus y, x
      \oplus y \oplus y) \equiv (y, x)$

* SAT = Boolean SATisfiability

* SMT = Satisfiability Modulo Theories

* Almost magic for what they can do. SAT can encode:

    * Fixed-size bit vectors (even multiplication, but slowly)

    * Bit manipulation operations (and, or, xor, shifts)

    * Arrays of fixed sizes

    * Conditionals

* SMT adds things like:

    * Linear arithmetic on integers (addition, subtraction,
      multiplication by constants)

    * Arrays of arbitrary size

    * Uninterpreted functions

# Automated Verification vs. Testing

* Advantages

    * Ensures that you will test \alert{all possible} input values

    * Sometimes faster than testing

* Disadvantages

    * Applicable to a smaller class of programs than testing

    * Sometimes much slower than testing

# Verifying Swap Correctness

~~~~
// Load the bitcode file generated by Clang
swapmod <- llvm_load_module "swap.bc";

// Extract a formal model of `swap_correct`
harness <- llvm_extract swapmod "swap_correct" llvm_pure;

// Use ABC prover to show it always returns non-zero
prove_print abc {{ \x y -> harness x y != 0 }};

# FFS Example

~~~~ .c
uint32_t ffs_ref(uint32_t word) {
  if(!word) return 0;
  for(int c = 0, i = 0; c < 32; c++)
    if(((1 << i++) & word) != 0)
      return i;
  return 0;
}
~~~~

~~~~ .c
uint32_t ffs_imp(uint32_t i) {
  char n = 1;
  if (!(i & 0xffff)) { n += 16; i >>= 16; }
  if (!(i & 0x00ff)) { n +=  8; i >>=  8; }
  if (!(i & 0x000f)) { n +=  4; i >>=  4; }
  if (!(i & 0x0003)) { n +=  2; i >>=  2; }
  return (i) ? (n+((i+1) & 0x01)) : 0;
}
~~~~

# Manual FFS Testing

~~~~ .c
int ffs_imp_correct(uint32_t x) {
  return ffs_imp(x) == ffs_ref(x);
}
~~~~

~~~~ .c
int main() {
  assert(ffs_imp_correct(0x00000000));
  assert(ffs_imp_correct(0x00000001));
  assert(ffs_imp_correct(0x80000000));

  assert(ffs_imp_correct(0xF0000000));
  assert(ffs_imp_correct(0x0000000F));
  assert(ffs_imp_correct(0xFFFFFFFF));
  return 0;
}
~~~~

# Random FFS Testing

* Same pros and cons as for the swap example

~~~~ .c
int main() {
  for(int idx = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    uint32_t x = rand();
    assert(ffs_imp_correct(x));
  }
  return 0;
}
~~~~

# Verifying FFS Harness

~~~~
m <- llvm_load_module "ffs.bc";

correct <- llvm_extract m "ffs_imp_correct" llvm_pure;

print "Proving ffs_imp_correct always returns true...";
prove_print abc {{ \x -> correct x == 1 }};
~~~~

(In `ffs_harness.saw`)

# Verifying FFS Without Wrapper

~~~~
m <- llvm_load_module "ffs.bc";

ref <- llvm_extract m "ffs_ref" llvm_pure;
imp <- llvm_extract m "ffs_imp" llvm_pure;

// Following equivalent to \x -> ref x == imp x
prove_print abc {{ ref === imp }};
~~~~

(In `ffs_eq.saw`)

# Exercises: FFS

0. Run the equivalence proofs in `ffs_harness.saw` and `ffs_eq.saw`

1. Port the FFS code to use `uint64_t`

  * Translate both reference and implementation

  * Which one is wrong?

2. Try to break the FFS code, in obvious and subtle ways

  * Can you make it do the wrong thing and not be caught?

3. Try to discover the "haystack" bug in `ffs_bug`

  * Use random testing (`ffs_bug_fail.saw`)

    * Increase the number of tests and see how long it takes

    * Try a similar case with `uint64_t`

  * Use `ffs_bug.saw` to find it with a SAT solver

# Pointers: Verifying XOR Swap Without Wrapper

    crucible_points_to xp (crucible_term y);
    crucible_points_to yp (crucible_term x);

# Simplifying the XOR Swap specification

~~~~
m <- llvm_load_module "xor-swap.bc";

let ptr_to_fresh nm ty = do {
    x <- crucible_fresh_var nm ty;
    p <- crucible_alloc ty;
    crucible_points_to p (crucible_term x);
    return (x, p);
};

    crucible_points_to xp (crucible_term y);
    crucible_points_to yp (crucible_term x);
};

crucible_llvm_verify m "swap_xor" [] true swap_spec abc;
~~~~

# Exercises: Code with Pointers

1. Try to break the XOR-based swapping in some way and run the proof

    * Use `swap.saw` or `swap_harness.saw`

2. Write a buggy version and use SAW to find inputs for which it's
   correct

   * These would be bad test cases!

3. Write a script to prove the FFS test harness using
   `crucible_llvm_verify`

   * You'll need `crucible_return {{ 1 : [32] }}` and `crucible_term`

   * You won't need `crucible_alloc` or `crucible_points_to`

# More Complex Verifications, In General

* Verifications in SAW consist of three phases

    * Initialize a starting state

    * Run the target code in that state

    * Check that the final state is correct

* Commands like `llvm_extract` just simplify a common case

* When running the target code, we can sometimes use previously-proven
  facts about code it calls

# Composition: Verifying Salsa20 (C code)

~~~~ .c
uint32_t rotl(uint32_t value, int shift) {
  return (value << shift) | (value >> (32 - shift));
}

void s20_quarterround(uint32_t *y0, uint32_t *y1,
                      uint32_t *y2, uint32_t *y3) {
  *y1 = *y1 ^ rotl(*y0 + *y3, 7);
  // ... and three more
}

void s20_rowround(uint32_t y[static 16]) {
  s20_quarterround(&y[0], &y[1], &y[2], &y[3]);
  // ... and three more
}
~~~~

# Composition: Verifying Salsa20 (SAW code)

~~~~
let quarterround_setup : CrucibleSetup () = do {
  (p0, y0) <- ptr_to_fresh "y0" i32;
  // ... and three more
  crucible_execute_func [p0, p1, p2, p3];
  let zs = {{ quarterround [y0,y1,y2,y3] }};
  crucible_points_to p0 (crucible_term {{ zs@0 }});
    // ... and three more
};

let rowround_setup = do {
  (y, p) <- ptr_to_fresh "y" (llvm_array 16 i32);
  crucible_execute_func [p];
  crucible_points_to p (crucible_term {{ rowround y }});
};
~~~~

# Sidebar: Array Sizes and Looping

* With the current version of SAW, programs must be \alert{finite}

    * SAT-based proofs need to know how many bits are involved

    * Inputs need to have fixed sizes

    * All pointers must point to data of known size

    * All loops need to execute a bounded number of types

* But Salsa20 can operate on any input size

    * So we prove it correct separately for several possible sizes

    * Our original version had a bug because of this!

* Future versions are likely to relax these restrictions

# Exercises: Composition

1. Run the monolithic and compositional proofs

  * `salsa.saw` and `salsa-compositional.saw`

2. Compare the timing of the two

  * When checking multiple sizes, how does it compare?

  * How many sizes before it becomes better?

3. Try to break the code and see what happens

  * First try a leaf function

  * Then try the top-level function

4. Can you break it so that one size succeeds but another fails?

# Sidebar: Fuzzing for Property Based Tests

* Klee is another LLVM symbolic execution system

* Doesn't aim for complete coverage, but very powerful

    * Better at finding bugs than SAW

    * Not generally usable for verification

* Associated fuzz testing system, `libfuzzer`

    * Includes a `main` function that calls fuzzing harness

~~~~ .c
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data,
                           size_t Size) {
  DoSomethingInterestingWithMyAPI(Data, Size);
  return 0;
}

# Sidebar: SAW on `libfuzzer` Harnesses

~~~~
let fuzzer_spec n = do {
  let ty = llvm_array n i8;
  (pdata, data) <- ptr_to_fresh "data" ty;
  crucible_execute_func
    [ pdata
    , crucible_term {{ `n : [64] }}
    ];
  crucible_return (crucible_term {{ 0 : [32] }});
};

m <- llvm_load_module "fuzztarget.bc";
for [1, 10, 20, 100] (\sz ->
  crucible_llvm_verify m "LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput"
    [] true (fuzzer_spec n) abc);

# Other Things Available in SAW

* Support for various languages

    * Others that compile to LLVM (simple C++ and Rust have been tested,
      others YMMV)

    * Languages that compile to JVM (only Java known to work well, but
      others might)

    * Coming soon: Rust, Go, some degree of machine code

* Some interactive proof tactics

    * Mostly rewriting with user-defined rules

    * Coming soon: bindings to external interactive provers, including
      Lean and Coq
